How do people learn underlying properties, such as mass and friction,
from objects' interactions in complex scenes? Such inferences are
difficult: the parameters cannot be directly observed and have
nonlinear effects on the physical dynamics. Yet, people learn
them. Participants predicted the stability of blocks stacked in
complex tower configurations. After observing the true outcome, they
answered, "which blocks are heavier?". Their responses indicate rapid
learning of the blocks' relative masses. We view such learning as
probabilistic inference in a generative model of Newtonian rigid-body
dynamics, and express this hypothesis in a model observer that infers
parameters using a procedure of approximate physical simulation. While
participants' judgments qualitatively matched the model's, they also
deviated in key ways that may be explained by resource
limitations. This work advances our understanding of how people infer
unobserved physical properties, and offers a framework for modeling
such behavior in complex, real-world scenes.
